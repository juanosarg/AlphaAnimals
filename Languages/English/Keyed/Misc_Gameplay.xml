	<LetterColossalAerofleetPasses>A strange floating creature bounces around in the distance, blundering around the landscape.\n\nA small horde of smaller specimens seem to be attracted to it, and follow it at a short distance.\n\nThey seem to be mostly harmless, and will probably leave the area when they have fed.</LetterColossalAerofleetPasses>

	<LetterBumbledroneMigration>A small group of bumbledrones, led by a bumbledrone queen, has entered this area.\n\nBumbledrones are generally not aggressive, unless threatened.\n\nThey will probably leave this area after a while in search of a quieter place, since the colony is too noisy for them.</LetterBumbledroneMigration>


	<LetterLabelManhuntingArcticLion>Stalking Arctic Lion</LetterLabelManhuntingArcticLion>
	<ManhuntingArcticLion>An arctic lion is stalking one of your colonists from the shadows.\n\nIt will be almost invisible until it decides to attack and is damaged by your colonists.

	<LetterLabelBlizzariskClutchMother>Blizzarisk clutch mother</LetterLabelBlizzariskClutchMother>
	<BlizzariskClutchMother>A huge spider like creature called a Blizzarisk, adapted to cold climates, wanders through this territory.\n\nThis Blizzarisk seems to be of much bigger size than usual, and is carrying a clutch of eggs on its back.

	<LetterLabelCactipinePod>Strange drop pod</LetterLabelCactipinePod>

	<LetterLabelGallatrossPasses>Gallatross wanders</LetterLabelGallatrossPasses>
	<LetterGallatrossPasses>Legends tell of a creature so huge and powerful that entire tribes fled at the sight of it.

Such questions are probably impossible to answer.</LetterGallatrossPasses>

	<LetterLabelBlackHiveAttack>Black hive attack</LetterLabelBlackHiveAttack>
	<LetterBlackHiveAttack>Insectoids in the rim are genetically altered organisms designed to fight mechanoid invasions. The Black Hive was the best of the best, designed to be much more aggressive than usual, and capable of laying siege to impregnable mechanoid fortresses. Existing insectoid species were improved and several new species were created and added to the Hive to increase its lethality.\n\nA group of Black Hive insectoids has tunneled to this location, and will attack your base immediately.</LetterBlackHiveAttack>
	
	<AA_LetterLabelMechanoidSappers>Mechanoid Sappers</AA_LetterLabelMechanoidSappers>
	<AA_LetterMechanoidSappers>A previously cloaked ancient mechanoid assembler has mysteriously appeared nearby.\n\nA swarm of mechanoids spews forth, quickly readying for an attack.\n\nOne of these mechanoids is a dangerous Demolisher, so they'll probably go straight for the walls!</AA_LetterMechanoidSappers>
